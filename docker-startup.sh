# Startup/entrypoint script for deployments based on Docker, vanilla or K8s

# in four places:
#
#  1. The app pod(s), setting PREPARE = 0
#  2. The celery-worker pod(s), setting PREPARE = 0 and RUN_MODE = celery-worker
#  3. One celery-beat pod, setting PREPARE = 0 and RUN_MODE = celery-beat
#  4. A post-deploy job, setting RUN_MODE = prepare
#
# To run as stand-alone Docker container, bundling all components, set
# ALEKSIS_dev__uwsgi__celery = true.

# Run mode to start container in
#
#  uwsgi       - application server
#  celery-$foo - celery commands (e.g. worker or beat)
#  *           - Anything else to run arguments verbatim
